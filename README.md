# Uncommon Expo CLI Error: DOM element issues with react-native-web

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when integrating libraries within an Expo project that uses `react-native-web`. The error stems from inconsistencies between how libraries expect the DOM to behave and the environment provided by Expo's web build system.  Error messages are often nonspecific, making diagnosis challenging.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the error during web build and app execution. Note the vague nature of the error message.

## Solution

The provided `bugSolution.js` file offers a possible solution depending on the specific problematic library. The general strategy involves either:

* **Using a library with better web support:** Replacing the problematic library with one explicitly supporting `react-native-web` is ideal.
* **Conditional rendering:** Employing conditional rendering (`if (typeof window !== 'undefined') { ... }`) to isolate DOM-dependent code to scenarios where it's safe to run (browser environment).  This prevents crashes in other environments.
* **Polyfilling:** If necessary, carefully polyfill missing web APIs; however, this should be a last resort, as it might lead to unintended side effects.

This example showcases the conditional rendering approach.   Remember to adjust the solution based on the specifics of your error and problematic library.

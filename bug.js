This error typically occurs when using Expo's `react-native-web` integration with a library that doesn't fully support the web platform or when there's a conflict between Expo's web build process and the library's assumptions. The error message itself is often quite general and may not directly pinpoint the root cause.  For instance, you might see errors related to `document` or `window` objects being undefined in contexts where the library expects them.
